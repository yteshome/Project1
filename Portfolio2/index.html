  <h2>The State of Michigan</h2>

    <p>The state of Michigan resembles the shape of a mitten, surrounded by 4 major fresh water great lakes.  It
       is devided in two peninsulas connected by the Mackinac Bridge which is a suspension bridge spanning the
       Straits of Mackinac to connect the Upper and Lower Peninsulas. The Mackinac Bridge is currently the fifth
       longest suspension bridge in the world. In 1998, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan became the
       longest with a total suspension of 12,826 feet. The Mackinac Bridge is the longest suspension bridge
       in the western hemisphere.</p>
        <p>
          <blockquote><em>
        The total length of the Mackinac Bridge is 26,372 feet. The length of the
        suspension bridge (including anchorages) is 8,614 feet. The length
        from cable bent pier to cable bent pier is 7,400 feet. Length of main
        span (between towers) is 3,800 feet.  The width of the roadway is
        54 feet. The height of the roadway at mid-span is approximately 200 feet
        above water level. The vertical clearance at normal temperature is 155
        feet at the center of the main suspension span and 135 feet at the
        boundaries of the 3,000 ft. navigation channel.</blockquote></em></p>
